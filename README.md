# Citibike NYC Bike Sharing
Module 14: Data Visualization - Tableau

## Overview of Project

### Purpose of Project
Can you extrapolate enough meaning via exploratory data analysis from bike sharing data based in New York City to create a successful copycat business in Des Moines, Iowa? Using our knowledge of data analytics, Python (and Pandas), this is the task. To harvest data from Citibike's bike sharing platform and create a business presentation to potential angel investors.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Project
Tablaeu presents a powerful tool in business analytics. It can handle large datasets and makes creating compelling visualizations extremely quick. The advantage here is obvious, users can spend much more time analyzing the story that the data tells rather than trying to build effective visuals to tell the story. Utilizing the "Story" feature in Tablaeu makes things even easier, by enabling analysts to build presentations and highlight important points. <img src="https://github.com/cb19weber/bikesharing/blob/main/images/nyc_story_2.png">

Some of the points that really jump off the page is the extreme disparity in use of the bike sharing program based on gender, the relatively stable, but gradual decline of bike sharing by older adults, and the concentration of starting point locations.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Challenges and Goals
Looking deeper into the data presented some additional important findings. One of the really impactful observations is the average duration of each rider's use of a bike. The greatest amount of bike sharers only used the bike they checked out for <i>five</i> minutes. And the vast majority of riders utilized the bike for no more than 20 minutes. <img src="https://github.com/cb19weber/bikesharing/blob/main/images/nyc_story_3.png"> The table above is filtered for durations of less than an hour, 1 hour, or 2 hours, but even changing the filter to view all rides demonstrates this same pattern.

So what does all of this say about the market for consumers of the bike ridesharing platform? Users are very predominantly male, they are mostly subscribers to the platform, they tend to use the program more greatly during their 20s, trickling off throughout adulthood. They tend to use the bikes for less than 20 minutes, and more than half of the time, for less than 5 minutes. They also tend to use the bikes mostly around 8-9am and 5-7pm. And the highest usage is concentrated in the center of Manhatten.

Putting all of that together, one might hypothesize that what makes the NYC bikesharing program successful are young, mostly-male, business professionals that take the bike to and from work in Manhatten. But why would this be? And how will that translate to Des Moines? A great idea would be to explore the incentives of this demographic.

If we rely on the fact the data tells us that most of the ridesharing usage is by subscribers, and factor in all of the demographic information, we can further postulate that it is very possible that the Citibike ridesharing program may be an alternative to vehicle ownership. New York City is a very condensed metropolitan area, broken up into neighborhoods that serve as epicenters where people spend most of their time. Like any major city, but certainly more so in one of the largest and most densly populated cities on Earth, traffic is extremely heavy and parking (like all real estate) is limited.

The difference between walking and driving is too big of a gap in time efficiency to be an effective alternative. But riding a bike? Riding a bike may often be just as quick if not quicker to navigate city streets than driving a car. Bikes have their own lanes, you don't necessarily have to follow all of the same traffic signals and rules, and they're easier to maneuver in tight spaces.

Why don't we see more female riders? There are certainly many upon many professional women in New York City!? There is great research and data here, but there could be more.

### More Research is Needed
I would love to see some additional statistics generated here. This is a great start, and as either the presenter or the user of the business pitch, I have a pretty good idea of how the Citibike platform is used in NYC and who the users are that makes it successful. But New York City is a <i>vastly</i> different place than Des Moines, Iowa. Fun fact! Did you know that the entire area of Manhatten is condensed into only 23 square miles? No wonder the average rides are so short. That area of Manhatten is basically 8 miles lattitude and 3-4 miles longitude. Even if you had to ride from one side to the other, on a bike you could cover that distance less than 30 minutes. Des Moines, Iowa on the other hand has a total area of over <i>NINETY</i> sqaure miles. There's a lot more room to roam in Iowa!

I'd love to see some calculations created using the data to find average speed of the riders. I'd also like to see some research on Des Moines. Where are the businesses? Where do people work and live? Are there perhaps any colleges or universities where the business might be able to serve a student population? I'd also love to do a deeper dive in the under representation of female riders. New York City is a very professional place. Is it dress attire that is holding the ladies back? It's probably easier to ride a bike in slacks than in a dress, but they could also simply change clothes when they got to work. I'd do the same even as a male, because I wouldn't want to get my dress clothes sweaty. But there must be some underlying causes of this.
